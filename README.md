This is a program to simulate and visualizae the PD World given as part of an Artifical Intelligence
Group Project during my coursework at the University of Houston.

I am not the sole author of this code, as I did not do the visualization, but reinforcement learning
algorithims were all my doing.

***Dependencies:***

You will need to have "pygame", and "numpy" installed. These should be installable via pip or your favorite package
manager.

***Running:***

To use, simply run "python3 main.py" and it will start up and start simulating.

Passing the "--debug" or "-d" option will enter it into debug mode and help diagnose erros if they are
encountered.

***Keybinds:***

While the GUI is focused, you may press:

***UP ARROW***-Speeds up the simulation.

***DOWN ARROW***-Slows down the simulation.

***SPACEBAR***-Pauses the simulation for 5 seconds, and then resumes.

***1-5***-Runs expirements 1-5 respectfully.

***Features:***

This is scaleable to any grid size, package count, and any number of dropoff and pickup locations.
Expirement and policies are designed such that you can easily create new expirement or add new policies.
